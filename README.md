# CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK

1. First created **CNN model** with training accuracy = 0.84 and validation accuracy = 0.45 with epoch =20 and training size= 1792 and validation size = 447
2. As the model was overfitting therefore used **dropouts** layer with 25% zeros, training accuracy = 0.53, validation=0.52

  a. saw a huge difference in validation accuracy
  b. overfitting got resolved
  c. training and validation accuracy dont have a huge gap now
3. Created more images using **Augmentor** library to rebalance class, after which accuracy of the model increased as training acc= and validation accuracy= 

Therefore Regularization techiniques, Dropout resolved the overfitting problem and Augmentor helped in increasing accuracy of the model.

Modification can be done with addition of 
a. different layer
b. changing epoch size
